## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My app will let users make and log in to an account, and search and browse for anime, they will then be able to add this anime to their library in a variety of ways including Completed, Wanting to Watch, and Watching. Each anime that you search for will have itâ€™s own page to view information about that show. 

The idea for this came being someone who watches a lot of anime and has watched a lot of anime throughout my life and wanting a place to store a list of all of those shows and keep track and everything I start and am currently watching while also finding new things.

Ways I see this could expand is having the ability to review the animes or gives them a star rating, adding social capabilities to the website such as forums, bring mangas into the mix, etc.

### Features
1. Search: This will allow users to search the Kitsu API for animes and then go the a specific animes page and choose options for the animes from the pages and get information on the anime from the page.
2. User Login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
3. Library: Ability to add animes to your library in a few different ways, either as Completed, Wanting to Watch, or Currently Watching also the ability to remove items from any of these lists(granted we all know you can't unsee some of these shows).
